# Support Policy

## Best-Effort Model

This catalog is a discovery surface for integrations created by Forward teams and community contributors.
Listings are best-effort and self-supported.

- No guaranteed response times.
- No field-team SLA.
- Support requests go to each integration repository issue tracker.

## Where To File Issues

Use the `issue_url` listed on each integration page.
